## Working Style
- Push back when what the user is saying is wrong or doesn't match your understanding.
- Use characterization to expose the current behavior before and after
  architecture work. Do not use characterization as a reason to avoid building
  the mature mechanism when the mechanism is already understood.
- Do not make changes just to make a test pass.
- When tests fail, report what the failure says.
- Avoid premature optimization, but flag designs that clearly will not scale
  past small column counts.
- Explain architecture and representation changes in enough detail for the user
  to assess direction without reading code. Summaries should include the
  mechanism being changed, assumptions being made, what is intentionally not changing, and any risks of drift such as storage handles or diagnostics becoming model logic.
- Do not move at "tiny step" pace by default. Small edits are useful when they
  reduce risk without changing the architecture, but architecture work should
  land as a complete mechanism.
- Prefer clean, single-purpose implementation shapes over keeping alternate
  paths, duplicate trace fields, or unused helpers "just in case." We use git;
  recreate removed code later if a real need returns.
- If an implementation is intentionally temporary, call it a scaffold explicitly,
  record what mature mechanism it is standing in for, and treat it as a debt
  item to remove or replace. Do not keep scaffolds merely because they are
  convenient, easy to test, or already present.
- Default to the most mature implementable mechanism. If the mature mechanism
  cannot be implemented yet, state the missing dependency explicitly and add it
  to `TODO.md` rather than quietly building a narrower substitute.
- If the mature mechanism is blocked by a structural dependency, make removing
  or fixing that blocker the next implementation task. Do not land a bounded,
  partial, or proxy version of the mechanism unless the user explicitly asks for
  that scaffold after the blocker is explained.
- Speak precisely about verification level. Do not say a mechanism "works",
  "is fixed", or "is done" for an architecture goal when only an isolated unit
  test or controlled diagnostic passes. State the actual level of evidence:
  unit mechanism, subsystem diagnostic, full text pipeline, or full hierarchy
  pipeline. For architecture goals, completion means the relevant full pipeline
  works or the remaining full-pipeline failure is explicitly reported.
- Choose production-grade dependencies and designs instead of local-only hacks or proof-of-concept shortcuts.
- Production may move from shared hosting to a VM when OS-level dependencies are the right production solution.
- Do not use paid libraries unless the user explicitly approves them.
- Do not add fallback paths unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- Do not add database migrations unless the user explicitly asks for them.
- Do not start, stop, or otherwise manage the local application server; the user controls it.
- Prefer characterization before new architecture.
- Do not tune thresholds just to make a test pass.
- When tests fail in a revealing way, report what the failure says.
- Keep the test suite conservative. Every test must protect a distinct,
  load-bearing behavior or failure boundary; avoid exhaustive permutations and
  tests that merely restate implementation details.
- Keep old comparison modes available when promoting a new default, unless there
  is a clear reason to remove them.
- Preserve deterministic behavior.
- Avoid premature optimization, but flag designs that clearly will not scale
  past small column counts.
- Prefer extracting common patterns into reusable components to reduce duplication
- Favor simplicity over complexity - remove unused exports, parameters, and code paths
- Eliminate code duplication through component extraction and parameterization

## Documentation Conventions
- Use `TODO.md` as the live ordered work queue. The first unchecked item is
  the next task. When an item is finished, mark it complete but do not remove
  it; the user owns clearing completed items. Update it when a new next step is
  inserted or when the direction changes enough that the queue needs rethinking.
- Use `decisions/` for dated architectural decisions and current rationale.
- Use `plans/` only for future work/roadmaps, not decisions already made.
- Use `social/` for public-facing post drafts or demo narration.
- Keep `README.md` current and avoid stale claims.
- If a user gives a durable directive, capture it here or in a dated decision
  note as appropriate.
